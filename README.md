# Single Channel Relay Module (BC547 Based)

This project is a **single channel relay module** designed to control **high-voltage or high-current loads** using a **low-voltage control signal** from a microcontroller or digital circuit. The design is created using **EasyEDA** and is suitable for students and beginners especially for understandning basic commands.

##  Project Overview

The relay is driven using an **NPN transistor (BC547)**, which allows a small control signal to safely switch a relay. This makes it possible to control electrical devices such as lamps, motors, or appliances using platforms like **Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi GPIO, or PLC outputs**.

An **LED indicator** shows the relay ON/OFF status, and a **flyback diode (1N4007)** is used to protect the transistor from voltage spikes generated by the relay coil.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

- A control signal is applied to the input pin.
- The BC547 transistor turns ON.
- The relay coil gets energized.
- Relay contacts (NO/NC) change state.
- External load is switched safely.
